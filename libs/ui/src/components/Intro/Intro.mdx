    # Welcome to UI component library ðŸŽ‰

    Because Storybook works separately from your app, you'll need to configure it for your specific stack and setup

    ## ðŸ“š How to start?
    
    Few easy steps. Let's start!

    ### Select the Node.js version 18+

    ```
    nvm use 18
    ```

    ### Install dependencies

    ```
    npm i
    ```

    ### Run the storybook

    ```
    npm run sb
    ```

    ## ðŸ“š How to run the tests?

    Prepare your environment

    ### Install Playwright to run UI tests
    ```
    npx playwright install
    ```

    ### Run UI tests
    ```
    npm run sb         # in the first terminal tab
    ```
    ```
    npm run test:ui    # in the second terminal tab
    ```

    or

    ### Run Unit tests
    ```
    npm run test:unit
    ```

    ## ðŸ“š How to use UI component library in your project

    Build and link the library

    ### Build the UI component library
    ```
    npm run build:lib
    ```

    ### Create symlink with UI component library via npm
    ```
    npm link
    ```

    ### Open your own project and 'link-install' the UI component library
    ```
    npm link @pathliving/components
    ```

    ### Import and use the Button from UI component library

    > <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>*Pay attention! Do not attempt to use it in 'server components'. The Button component can only be used in 'client components' because it has event handlers</p>

    ```
    import { Button } from '@pathliving/components';

    export default function Page() {
      return (
        <>
          Home page
          <Button onClick={() => alert('Hi!')}>Click me!</Button>
        </>
      );
    }
    ```

    ## A Few Words Before Wrapping Up

    > Hi! My name is Andrii, and I'm a Front-end engineer with 4 years of experience. You can find the details of my resume at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rz-owmwv2AwAs4fT2Taj53sFcw1UqTZF/view). However, I decided to be less verbose and instead focus on writing as much as possible within one working day to submit for your review. You can see the list of completed tasks in the Git commit history, but trust me, it was a journey from the "npx storybook@latest init" command to "git push origin HEAD" ([link to github repo](https://github.com/pathliving/components)). Most of the errors and issues encountered along the way were resolved, though there is always room for improvement. Please be generous with your feedback ;) Have a peaceful day!
